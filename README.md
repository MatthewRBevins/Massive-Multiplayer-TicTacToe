# Massive-Multiplayer-TicTacToe
Play TicTacToe with up to 10 players on a 75 x Infinite board
You can change the variables at the top (PlayerCount, BoardWitdh, BoardLength) to change parameters because I was too lazy to make actual good anything
You can go infinitely downwards but the formatting gets messed up when the numbers are too long
